# Photon Pushers
### Made with **Unity 2020.2.1f1**
 
Pushers - duo versus little game, which was created on Unity with Photon Unity Networking System (v2).
This is my second (more successful) try in PUN 2. Game concept is simple, but I'm pretty happy with the result.

## What I Learned

* How PUN 2 matchmaking system works
* How to create rooms and lobbies in PUN 2
* Networking can be really funny. Sometimes not
